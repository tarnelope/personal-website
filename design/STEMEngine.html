<h2>STEM Engine</h2>
<p>
Many parents wish to become more involved in their children's education. However, many feel impeded by lack of time, lack of confidence, or lack of teaching resources. My team, composed of Sam King, Amit Shah, Cole Bennett, and I, sought to break down these barriers by creating a low-cost, mail-order science kit subscription program. The kits would arrive periodically, as specified by the parents, and include specialized instruction sets targeted at empowering them to confidently explain new concepts to their children.

<p>We prototyped the user interface for the STEM Engine service using Wordpress. Using it in our user tests, we were able to better understand how it could effectively supplement and enhance their children's and their own learning experience. Check it out in the link below.</p>
